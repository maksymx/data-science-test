# data-science-test

## Overview ## 

This is a take-home assignment for candidates for the data scientist position at Emogi. 
We except candidate to demonstrate the following abilities through this assignment:

1) An ability to write well-organized and easy-to-read code in general programming 
2) An ability to design an empirical research experiment
3) An ability to aticulate the assumptions and limitations of research 
4) An ability to think out-of-the-box and to propose alternative paths, improvements, and future work

Of course everyone is not perfect and you have limited time :-) 
Our suggestion is to spend a couple of hours to complete the task and let your intellectual curiosity guide from there. 

## Task ##

Included in this repository are two files: 

1) tweets.txt, where each line includes the text of a tweet that included emoji (but the emoji has been removed);

2) emoji.txt, where each line includes the name of emoji for the corresponding text in tweets.txt. 

Your task is to build a predictive model of emoji in given a piece of text. Our suggestion is to use standard vectorization methods and machine learning classifiers (of your choice). Once done, please submit your script to conduct the experiement, an instruction to reproduce your experiment results, and a report that includes the following:

1. Experiment results, including the standard metrics e.g. precisions, acurracies, and f-measures, and confusion matrices (if applicable). 
2. Your findings and observations based on the experiments, including limitation and assumption.
2. How you chose the vectorization method and algorithms.
3. What the experiments may be useful for and how we may improve the utility of it. 

Please let Keisuke (keisuke@emogi.com) know any question or feedback. 
Have fun!
